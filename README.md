The Payroll Management System is designed to simplify the management of employee salaries, deductions, and leave applications. This section will guide you through the core functionalities provided by the system to ensure you can navigate and use it efficiently.

### Security and Confidentiality
To maintain the security and confidentiality of employee information, the system employs a secure login process:
